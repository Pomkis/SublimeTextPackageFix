### SublimeTextPackageFix

📦 The packagecontrol.io website is not available to some people.

If you get the error "There are no packages available for installation" or no error at all when
installing Package Control but it doesn't install, you can fix it.

Solution:
To fix sublime packages you need to use the run.py file. Done!

If you want to use the latest version of channel_v3.json that is currently available,\
then please use [packagecontrol.io](https://packagecontrol.io/channel_v3.json), if the site is not working then use web.archive.org,\
download the latest capture and place it in "Installed Packages", after click on\
valid.py (to remove archive.org links) and run run.py again. Perfect, you have fixed everything\
and all packages are installed correctly

Enjoy!
