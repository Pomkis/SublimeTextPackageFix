### SublimeTextPackageFix

📦 The packagecontrol.io website is not available to some people.

If you get the error "There are no packages available for installation" or no error at all when
installing Package Control but it doesn't install, you can fix it.

Solution:
Drop these files with replacement to "%AppData%\Sublime Text"

Enjoy!
